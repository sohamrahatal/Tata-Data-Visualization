# Tata-Data-Visualization - Forage Job Simulation
### 1. Tata Data Visualization : Task 3
Simple visuals created on Power BI Desktop using the dataset of an online retail shop provided in the task.

### 2. Purpose
To create visuals based on the questions given in the task.

Questions are as follows:

Question 1
The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

Question 2
The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

Question 3
The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

Question 4
The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

### 3. Features / Highlights

For the first question, the CEO has requested a trend of the revenue to see if there is any
seasonality in the store sales. My analysis shows that there are some months of the year where
exceptional growth is witnessed. The data shows that the revenue in the first 8 months is fairly
constant as the average revenue generated for these 8 months is around $685k. The increase
in revenue starts in the month of September, where the revenue increases by 40% over the
previous month. This trend continues till the month of November where it reached 1.5 million
USD, the highest during the entire year. The data is incomplete for the month of December,
therefore, no conclusion can be drawn from it, unfortunately. This analysis shows that the retail
store sales are impacted by the seasonality which usually occurs in the last 4 months of the
year.

The second visual shows how the top 10 countries which have opportunities for growth are
performing. This data does not include the UK as the country already has high demand and I’ve
been told you’re more focused on the countries where demand can be increased. The analysis
shows that countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and France have high volumes
of units bought and revenue generated. I would suggest that these countries should be focused
on to ensure that measures are taken to capture these markets even more.

The third analysis has been performed on the top 10 customers who have purchased the most
from the store. The data shows that there is not much of a difference between the purchases
made by the top 10 customers. The highest revenue generating customer only purchased 17%
more than the 2nd highest which shows that the business is not relying only on a few customers
to generate the revenue. This shows that the bargaining power of customers is low and the
business is in a good position.

Finally, the map chart shows the regions that have generated the most revenue compared with
the regions that have not. It can be seen that apart from the UK, countries such as Netherlands,
Ireland, Germany, France and Australia are generating high revenue and the company should
invest more in these areas to increase demand for products. The map also shows that most of
the sales are only in the European region with very few in the American region. Africa and Asia
do not have any demand for the products, along with Russia. A new strategy targeting these
areas has the potential to boost sales revenues and profitability.
